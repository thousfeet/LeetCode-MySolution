## [717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters][1]

> We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

>Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

>**Example 1:**

>Input: 
>bits = [1, 0, 0]
>Output: True
>Explanation: 
>The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.

>**Example 2:**

>Input: 
>bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
>Output: False
>Explanation: 
>The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.

>Note:
>   >1 <= len(bits) <= 1000.
>   >  bits[i] is always 0 or 1.

【思路】
三秒签到题。
因为如果有 1 就一定要凑 10、11，也即不管 1 后面是啥，只要逢 1 都必须要带走后面一个，如果能顺利遍历到最末尾（不会被前面的数带走），就OK

【代码】
```
bool isOneBitCharacter(int* bits, int bitsSize) {
    bool flag = false;
	for(int i = 0; i < bitsSize;)
    {
    	if(i == bitsSize-1) flag = true;
    	if(bits[i] == 1) i+=2;
    	else i++;
	}
	return flag;
}
```
