##674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

>  Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

>**Example 1:**

>Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
>Output: 3
>Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
>Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 

>**Example 2:**

>Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
>Output: 1
>Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 

>Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000. 

【思路】
一道签到题我打了有20分钟...orz
先是被数组长度为1的时候wa样例，于是特判了一下长度，然后是最后末尾段没有一个递减的数会出错，于是又特判了一下`i+1 == numsSize-1`的时候- -..真是打得丑...

【代码】
```
int findLengthOfLCIS(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    
    if(numsSize == 1) return 1;
    
    int res = 0;
    int len = 1;
	for(int i = 0; i < numsSize-1; i++)
    {
    	if(nums[i+1] > nums[i])
		{
			len++;
			if(i+1 == numsSize-1) res = max(res,len);
		} 
		else
		{
			res = max(res,len);
			len = 1;
		} 
	}
	return res;
}
```
