## [696. Count Binary Substrings][1]

> Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

>Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

>**Example 1:**

>Input: "00110011"
>Output: 6
>Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

>Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

>Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

>**Example 2:**

>Input: "10101"
>Output: 4
>Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.

>Note:
>    >s.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
>   s will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.

【思路】
签到题。求0和1成团粘一起的子串个数，一串里面0和1的数目要相同。
用 s0 存一团里面 0 的个数， s1 存 1 的个数，因为数目要相同，所以每一团里面的可行子串数取较小的那个就好了。

【代码】
```
int countBinarySubstrings(char* s) {
	int count = 0;
	int len = strlen(s);
	int s0 = 0, s1 = 0;
	bool flag = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i < len; i++)
	{
		if(s[i]-'0' == 0)
		{
			if(flag == 0) s0++;
			else
			{
				count += min(s0,s1);
				flag = 0;
				s0 = 1;
			}
		}
		else
		{
			if(flag == 1) s1++;
			else
			{
				count += min(s0,s1);
				flag = 1;
				s1 = 1;
			}
		}
	}    
	return count + min(s0,s1);
}
```
