##682. Baseball Game

>  You're now a baseball game point recorder.

>Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:
>
> >    Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
> >    "+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
> >    "D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
> >    "C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.

>Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.

>You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.

>**Example 1:**

>Input: ["5","2","C","D","+"]
>Output: 30
>Explanation: 
>Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
>Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
>Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.  
>Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
>Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.

>**Example 2:**

>Input: ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
>Output: 27
>Explanation: 
>Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
>Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
>Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
>Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.  
>Round 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.
>Round 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.
>Round 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.
>Round 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points. The sum is 27.

>Note:
>   >The size of the input list will be between 1 and 1000.
>   >Every integer represented in the list will be between -30000 and 30000.

【思路】
栈的模拟orz，因为tag是stack所以连想都不用想了...

【代码】
```
int calPoints(char** ops, int opsSize) {
	
	int score[1001];
	int top = -1;
	for(int i = 0; i < opsSize; i++)
	{
		if(ops[i][0] == 'C') top--;
		else if(ops[i][0] == 'D') score[++top] = score[top-1]*2;
		else if(ops[i][0] == '+') score[++top] = score[top-1]+score[top-2];
		else score[++top] = atoi(ops[i]);
	}
	
	int ans = 0;   
	for(int i = 0; i <= top; i++) ans += score[i];
	
	return ans;
}
```

题目本身是没啥特别的，倒是学到了c语言字符串和数字互转的函数（头文件是stdlib.h）

**字符串转化为数字**

 ● atof()：将字符串转换为双精度浮点型值。
  ● atoi()：将字符串转换为整型值。
  ● atol()：将字符串转换为长整型值。
  ● strtod()：将字符串转换为双精度浮点型值，并报告不能被转换的所有剩余数字。
  ● strtol()：将字符串转换为长整值，并报告不能被转换的所有剩余数字。
  ● strtoul()：将字符串转换为无符号长整型值，并报告不能被转换的所有剩余数字。


    int num_int;
    double num_double;
    char str_int[30] = "435";         //将要被转换为整型的字符串
    char str_double[30] = "436.55";  //将要被转换为浮点型的字符串
    
    num_int = atoi(str_int);          //转换为整型值
    num_double = atof(str_double);  //转换为浮点型值

  

  **数字转化为字符串**

  ● itoa()：将整型值转换为字符串。
  ● ltoa()：将长整型值转换为字符串。
  ● ultoa()：将无符号长整型值转换为字符串。
  ● gcvt()：将浮点型数转换为字符串，取四舍五入。
  ● ecvt()：将双精度浮点型值转换为字符串，转换结果中不包含十进制小数点。
  ● fcvt()：指定位数为转换精度，其余同ecvt()。
  还可以使用sprintf系列函数把数字转换成字符串，其比itoa()系列函数运行速度慢。


    int num_int = 435;
    double num_double = 435.10f;
    char str_int[30];
    char str_double[30];
    
    itoa(num_int, str_int, 10);  //把整数num_int转成字符串str_int 参数10表示按十进制类型进行转换
    gcvt(num_double, 8, str_double);  //把浮点数num_double转成字符串str_double 参数8表示精确位数
