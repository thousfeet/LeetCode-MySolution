## 338. Counting Bits

> Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

>**Example:**
>For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

>   It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
>   Space complexity should be O(n).
>   Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

为什么今天的题都这么有趣23333

0 1   2 3   4 5 6 7   8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15   16 17
0 1   1 2   1 2 2 3   1 2 2  3  2  3  3  4    1  2  
找规律？？

看了discuss惊了，好像还真是这么一回事， An easy recurrence for this problem is f[i] = f[i / 2] + i % 2.

    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] f = new int[num + 1];
        for (int i=1; i<=num; i++) f[i] = f[i >> 1] + (i & 1);
        return f;
    }
