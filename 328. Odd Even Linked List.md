## 328. Odd Even Linked List

> Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

>You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

>**Example:**
>Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL,
>return 1->3->5->2->4->NULL.

>Note:
>The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
>The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...

【思路】
因为要求O(1)的空间复杂度，所以不能另开一个链表来存偶数串，就只能在原链表基础上面改。改的方法也就是保存下奇数链的末尾和偶数链的末尾，然后就是while循环里面那串操作了，对照example一下就能看懂。

【代码】
```
 ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
       if(!head) return head;
       ListNode *odd = head, *evenhead = head->next, *even = evenhead;
	   while(even && even->next) 
	   {
	   		odd->next = even->next;
	   		even->next = even->next->next;
	   		odd = odd->next;
	   		even = even->next;
			odd->next = evenhead;
	   }
	   return head;
    }
```
