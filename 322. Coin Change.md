## 322. Coin Change

 >You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

>Example 1:
>coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
>return 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)

>Example 2:
>coins = [2], amount = 3
>return -1.

>Note:
>You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin. 

看着不像是贪心..卧槽 貌似是完全背包...

```
int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) 
    vector<int> A(amount+1, amount+1);
    A[0] = 0;
    for (int coin : coins) {
        for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            A[i] = min(A[i], A[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }
    return A[amount] > amount ? -1 : A[amount];
}
```

一个貌似挺厉害的但是没看懂的解释...
