##121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

> Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

>If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

>**Example 1:**

>Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
>Output: 5

>max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)

>**Example 2:**

>Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
>Output: 0

>In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

【思路】
就只要一路遍历，每次找到历史最低点去和它做差取最大就好了。
这题就是上次那个收手续费的股市操作简简简化版。

【代码】
```
int maxProfit(int* prices, int pricesSize) {
    int low = INT_MAX;
    int ans = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < pricesSize; i++)
    {
    	if(prices[i] < low) low = prices[i];
		else ans = max(ans,prices[i]-low);
	}
	return ans;
}
```
