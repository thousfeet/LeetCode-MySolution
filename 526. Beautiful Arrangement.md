## 526. Beautiful Arrangement

>  Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:
>
>   The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
>   i is divisible by the number at the ith position.

>Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

>**Example 1:**
>
>Input: 2
>Output: 2
>Explanation: 

>The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

>Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

>Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

>The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

>Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

>Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.

【思路】
深搜练习，最不熟练的一种深搜题了，还是看了discuss才知道怎么打的...
思路其实就是，对于某一个位置，我for一下1~N先放下一个能放的，标记一下放下的这个我已经用过了（`used=1`），好了然后继续做pos+1的位置（`dfs(pos+1)`），完了之后把used改0，继续那个for循环，试着换后面的放放看。出口是当做到pos>N的位置，说明前面1~N个都已经放好了，那么count++。

【代码】
```
int used[16];
int count = 0;

void dfs(int pos, int N)
{
	if(pos > N) count++;
	for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
	{
		if(used[i] == 0 && (pos%i == 0 || i%pos == 0)) 
		{
			used[i] = 1;
			dfs(pos+1,N);
			used[i] = 0;
		}
	}
}

int countArrangement(int N) {
	dfs(1,N);
	return count;
} 
```
